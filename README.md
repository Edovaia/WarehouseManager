The development of this software has enabled the company I work for to achieve various objectives across multiple areas.

The "Warehouse" page provides warehouse managers with a clear and detailed overview of the products in stock. It allows them to instantly assess when to place an order by comparing the stock levels with predefined thresholds.

The "Orders" page enables warehouse supervisors to quickly access and respond to product-specific order requests from employees. This tool optimizes communication by ensuring an effective and direct link between the operational staff and the orders department, establishing an additional communication channel between the two.

The software has also enhanced the interaction between the company and its customers. The "Work Orders" page, accessible to customers after authentication, provides real-time updates on the status of their vehicle-related work. Additionally, the "Customer Service" section, with a dedicated form, allows customers to easily request information from the management.

From an economic perspective, the project has generated significant savings for the company, thanks to the use of open-source software, editors, web applications, and programming languages. This approach contrasts with similar products on the market, which are often offered at much higher prices by other software vendors.
